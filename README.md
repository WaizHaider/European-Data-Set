 this data analytics report provides valuable insights and analysis on the European Flights Data, showcasing the importance of data cleaning, visualization, and analysis in understanding the impact of COVID-19 on the aviation industry.

The European Flights Data analytics report focuses on analyzing and cleaning the dataset to derive insights and answers to key questions related to the impact of COVID-19 on flights. Using R language in R Studio, I employed data cleaning techniques to ensure the accuracy and completeness of the dataset, and performed exploratory data analysis to identify patterns and trends in the data.
